# TheFinalScore-Backend
This is the readme for the Final Score project.

## Getting started
To get started you need to install a program to run the backend with. A example is Apache Netbeans. Open the movie.java file in the entities folder. Now you can start it with pressing F6 (It is recomended to "Clean and build" first). Now a tab should pop up in your browser. Don't worry if you get the 401/403 error message. It works anyway. 

### Built with
* Java
